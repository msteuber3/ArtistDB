Create database if none exists

display database

add entry - Note the time and include two text boxes. If both are filled, allow user to submit
write the info to the database

delete entry - each entry should have a delete button

edit entry - each entry should be adjustable and the db should be updated when a button is pushed

optional - edit undo to prevent the entry from being updated
update all button

save each edit in a buffer to send to python script

So. JS frontend. buttons send shit to python script to update db
